# INSTALLATION

To install the SDK packages, enter the "packages" directory and find the linux
distribution and processor architecture you are using. Specific instructions for
each distribution follows below.

After installing all necessary packages, reboot the system so that udev reads
the updated configuration and the driver loads.

## Ubuntu and Debian

Install delivered versions of our packages using:

    dpkg -i packagename

Use the following order:

- spd-adq-pci-dkms (not needed for USB devices)
- libadq0
- adqtools

GUI applications:

- adqassist (requires libadq0 and adqtools)
- digitizerstudio (requires libadq0)

## OpenSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise

**Note** For SUSE Linux Enterprise, use OpenSUSE Leap packages.

Install `dkms` packge using:

    zypper install dkms

Install delivered versions of our packages using:

    rpm -U packagename

Use the following order:

- spd-adq-pci-dkms (not needed for USB devices)
- libadq0
- adqtools

GUI applications:

- adqassist (requires libadq0 and adqtools)
- digitizerstudio (requires libadq0)

## Fedora

Install delivered versions of our packages using:

    dnf install packagename

Use the following order:

- spd-adq-pci-dkms (not needed for USB devices)
- libadq0
- adqtools

GUI applications:

- adqassist (requires libadq0 and adqtools)
- digitizerstudio (requires libadq0)

## AlmaLinux OS / CentOS / Red Hat Enterprise Linux / Scientific Linux

**Note** For RHEL, use AlmaLinux packages.

Install delivered versions of our packages using:

    yum install packagename

Use the following order:

- spd-adq-pci-dkms (not needed for USB devices)
- libadq0
- adqtools

GUI applications:

- adqassist (requires libadq0 and adqtools)
- digitizerstudio (requires libadq0 and EPEL, see below)

**EPEL:** Digitizer Studio requries _hdf5_ and _udt_ which are only available
through the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository. To install
Digitizer Studio you either need to download and install these packages, with
dependencies, separately or enable the EPEL repository for automatic dependency
resolution. Enabling EPEL is done by running the following command:

    yum install epel-release

AlmaLinux OS 8, CentOS 8 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 also requires
_powertools_:

    yum install dnf-plugins-core && dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools

# Device access permissions

ADQ devices show up as `/dev/adq_pcie_` and `/dev/adq_usb_`, the default udev
setting is to add read/write access to the user group "adq". The libadq0 package
will create a user group called "adq" if that group doesn't already exist in the
system. To be able to access the devices, in order to add your user to the "adq"
group use the command:

    usermod -a -G adq username

The user will have to logout and login again for the changes to take effect.

# Kernel module version compatibility

The PCIe kernel module supports kernel versions from 2.6.32 and forward, however
kernel version 3.8.0 or newer is recommended.

The PCIe kernel module is not signed and thus will not load if your kernel uses
"secure boot". If "secure boot" is enabled, it will need to be disabled before
the kernel module can be loaded. Refer to your distribution documentation on how
to do this.

# API user guide

The API user guide is included as a .pdf document in the "doc" directory. All
API functions are described there.

# Example code

Example code for different languages can be found in the "examples" directory.

## C/C++ examples

C/C++ example code is compiled using Make by going to the directory with the
Makefile and running "make". To setup include paths and defines for the compiler
"pkg-config" is used in the C/C++ examples. If not already installed, pkg-config
can be installed using the appropriate distribution package tools.

## Python examples

The Python examples are written for Python 3. They use the "ctypes" module to
call ADQAPI functions and convert Python data structures to the appropriate
format.

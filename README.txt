I'm not taking everything from DarkRadioSimulations. I have been on the project for 2.5 years and not used most of the things in it.


### Commit prefix
`SIM:` Simulation related. New comsol file, change of parameters in existing file, etc.

No prefix indicates the commit was before 3/31/21 or someone was lazy and should be given a stern talking to.
